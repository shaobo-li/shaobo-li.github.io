== About me
I am currently Associate Professor of Business Analytics at University of Kansas. I earned my Ph.D in Business Administration and Masters of Statistics from University of Cincinnati. My PhD advisors are [https://business.uc.edu/faculty-and-research/departments/obais/faculty/yan-yu.html Prof. Yan Yu] and [https://www.yichenqin.com/ Prof. Yichen Qin]. My research interests lie broadly in statistics, marketing, and information systems. In particular, I am interested in robust regression, nonparametric and semiparametric methods, discrete data analysis, data privacy and some finance topics including corporate bankruptcy and equity premium prediction. My research work has been published in premier journals in statistics and business domains, including /JASA, ISR and Marketing Science/. Besides work, I am a high-tech fan and always interested in learning the latest technologies. I also love playing basketball and traveling with family.
